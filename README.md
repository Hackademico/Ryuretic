Ryuretic: A Modular Framework for RYU
Ryuretic is a modular, SDN-based, framework for network application
development. It allows network operators to work directly with packet
header fields at various levels of the OSI model, including L2, L3, L4,
and shim layer protocols. The user simply chooses match fields and
selects provided operations to update the OpenFlow switch.
